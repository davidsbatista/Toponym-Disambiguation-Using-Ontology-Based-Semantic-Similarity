=======================

This is code to populate the database with Information Content, perform several semantic similarity measures, and perform experiments using a dataset of hand-annotated toponyms. 

It is based on a Portuguese geographic ontology: `Geo-Net-PT02 <http://dmir.inesc-id.pt/project/Geo-Net-PT_02_in_English>`_
